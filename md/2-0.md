###1. There's only one garbage collector

Nope, and 4 isn't the right answer either. The HotSpot JVM has a total of 4 garbage collectors: 
[Serial, Parallel / Throughput. CMS, and the new kid on the block G1](http://blog.takipi.com/garbage-collectors-serial-vs-parallel-vs-cms-vs-the-g1-and-whats-new-in-java-8/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=in-post&utm_content=gcmisconceptions&utm_campaign=java). 
But wait there's more, there are also non-standard garbage collectors and more adventurous implementations like 
[Shenandoah](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/189) or collectors other JVMs use (like C4, the pauseless collector by Azul). 
HotSpot's default is the Parallel / Throughput collector and often it's not the best option for your application. 
For example, the CMS and G1 collectors will cause less frequent GC pauses. But when a pause do comes, 
its duration will most likely be longer than the one caused by the Parallel collector. 
On the other hand, the Parallel collector usually achieves higher throughput for the same size of heap.

__Takeaway:__ Choose the right garbage collector for the job depending on your requirements: Acceptable GC pause frequency and duration.
