###4. Average transaction time is the most important metric to look out for

If you're only monitoring the average transaction time in your server then you're missing out on the outliers. 
There's low awareness to how devastating this can be to the users of your system. For example, 
a transaction that would normally take under 100ms, can get affected by a GC pause and take a minute to complete. 
This can go unnoticeable to anyone but the user if you're only looking at the average transaction time. 
Now consider this scenario for 1% or more of your users and you can see how easily it can be overlooked 
when you're only looking at the average. For more latency related issues and the way to get it right,

__Takeaway:__ Keep an eye out on the outliers and know how your system behaves for the 99th percentile ([Not that 1%](http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Who-Is-The-1.jpg)).
