###3. G1 solves all problems

Introduced in Java 7 and going through a lot of changes and modifications, the G1 collector is the newest addition to the JVMs garbage collectors. 
The main advantage is that it solves the fragmentation problem that's common with the CMS collector: 
GC cycles free chunks of memory from old gen and make it look like swiss cheese until a moment comes where the JVM can't handle it 
and has to stop and handle the fragmentation. But that's not the end of the story, other collectors can outperform G1 in certain cases. 
It all depends on what you're requirements are.

__Takeaway:__ There's no miracle solution to all GC problems, experimentation is needed to help you choose the right collector for your JVM.
