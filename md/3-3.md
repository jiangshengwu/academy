###7. GC logs cause a big overhead

This one is simply not true, especially by the default log settings. 
The data is extremely valuable and Java 7 introduced hooks to control their size and make sure they will not use up all your hard drive. 
If you're not collecting GC log data then you're missing out on pretty much the only way for you to know how your JVMs garbage collection behaves in production. 
There's usually a 5% upper bound for acceptable GC overhead, it's a tiny price to pay for being able to know what kind of toll GC pauses take from your system and act on minimizing it.

__Takeaway:__ Use everything in your power to get the most data you can out of your system in production. It's a whole different world out there.
