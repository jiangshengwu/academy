###6. Tuning can solve everything

If your application needs to keep a large state that changes frequently, 
there isn't much benefit you can gain from tuning the heap of your JVM. Long GC pauses will be inevitable. 
A solution can come on the architectural changes front, where making sure a process that has a critical procedure / bottleneck affecting response time, 
will not contain a large state. Large state and responsiveness don't go well together: Breaking it down to different processes would be the way to go.

__Takeaway:__ Not all issues can be solved through tuning JVM flags, sometimes you simply need to go back to the drawing board.
