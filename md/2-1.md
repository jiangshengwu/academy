###2. Parallel = Concurrent

A Garbage Collection cycle can be either STW (Stop-The-World) and cause a GC pause, or it can be done concurrently without stopping the application. 
When we go a step further, the GC algorithm itself can be either serial (single threaded) or parallel (multi-threaded). 
This is why when we refer to a concurrent GC, it does not necessarily mean it's done in parallel, and the other way around, 
when we refer to a serial GC it doesn't necessarily mean it causes a pause. In the Garbage Collection world, 
Concurrent and Parallel are two absolutely different terms where Concurrent refers to the GC cycle, and Parallel refers to the GC algorithm itself.

__Takeaway:__ Garbage collection is a 2 step game, the way to invoke a GC cycle and the way it goes about its business are two different things.
