###5. Reducing new object allocation rates will improve GC behaviour

We can roughly separate the objects in our system to 3: Long-lived objects, 
where usually there's not much we can do about them, mid-lived objects, that cause the biggest issues, 
and short-lived objects, who usually get freed and allocated quickly so they're gone by the next GC cycle. 
The mid-lived objects are the ones that focusing on their allocation rate could bring positive results. 
Concentrating on the short-lived and long-lived objects wouldn't usually prove effective, and controlling the mid-lived objects is often a very hard task.

__Takeaway:__ It's not the object allocation rate alone that throttles your servers, it's the type of objects in play that cause all the trouble.
